# Validator

This page covers how to use Validator within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: setup and references to the specific Validator wrapper.

## Setup
- Get a Validator api key from https://validator.minions.farm/settings and
either set it as an environment variable (`VALIDATOR_API_KEY`) or initialize
the constructor with `validator_api_key`.

## Wrapper

### Utility

To import the Validator utility:

```python
from langchain.utilities import ValidatorWrapper

validator = ValidatorWrapper()
# the url points to a webpage with validation visualization
url = validator.run(
    input_text="An apple is red. A banana is yellow. What color is an apple?",
    generated_text="An apple is red",
)
```

To try the Validator wrapper yourself, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/tools/validator.html).

### Tool

You can also easily load Validator as a Tool (to use with an Agent):
```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["validator"])
```

For more information on this, see [this page](/docs/modules/agents/tools)
