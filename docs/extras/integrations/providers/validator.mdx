# Validator

This page covers how to use the Validator within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: setup and references to the specific Validator wrapper.

## Setup
- Get a Validator api key and either set it as an environment variable (`VALIDATOR_API_KEY`)
or initialize the constructor with `validator_api_key`.

## Wrappers

### Utility

To import the Validator utility:

```python
from langchain.utilities import ValidatorWrapper
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/tools/validator.html).

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:
```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["validator"])
```

For more information on this, see [this page](/docs/modules/agents/tools)
